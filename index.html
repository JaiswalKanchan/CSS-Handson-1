     <p> when comparing css class vs ID, The difference is that css class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it is used by Javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style or a set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID .both are used to target elements which a style should be applied.</p>
